# Pronounciation evaluation

This project consists of two parts:

## The server
This server built with ExpressJS (Node JS) runs in port 3000 and provides the mocked data for the SPA

## The SPA
It is made with React (using the scaffolding of create-react-app) and runs in port 8000.
As it works with mock data it will always return a "Well done, your score is 90%" feedback

They should be run together so the SPA works properly
